# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain `Inter.woff2` — the Inter typeface in WOFF2 format.

The application currently loads Inter from Google Fonts CDN. If you want to
self-host instead, download from https://rsms.me/inter/ and place the file here,
then update `globals.css` to use `@font-face` instead of the Google Fonts import.
